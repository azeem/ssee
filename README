Simple Symbolic Expression Evaluator
------------------------------------

SSEE is a simple LISP interpreter written in C++.
It supports 6 different basic data types viz. Integer,
String, Boolean, None, Symbol and a composite data type, Cons.
SSEE also supports first-class functions ie. It treats
functions as first-class objects allowing them to be passed
as parameters, returned from another function or assigned to variables.
The current implementation supports 13 different builtin functions.
